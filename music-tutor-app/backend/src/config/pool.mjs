// pool is used instead of client because client needs to open and close connection for each request whereas pool keeps open connections to be used when needed
// a pool allows multiple concurrent queries whereas a client connection allows only serial queries from the requesting source.

// useful custom wrapper function so you don't have to connect to pool in other files
// pool.query returns a promise so whatever calls it , e.g. route handler middleware, should use async/await
export const query = (text, params) => pool.query(text, params); // pool.query handles the opening and closing of inidivdual connections
